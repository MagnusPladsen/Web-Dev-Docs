HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages. It is the foundation of every website and it defines the structure and content of a web page. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. These tags define the different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
