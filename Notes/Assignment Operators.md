In JavaScript, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They are shorthand notations for the basic assignment operator '='. The basic assignment operator assigns the value on the right-hand side of the operator to the variable on the left-hand side.

Here are some common assignment operators in JavaScript:

## 1. = (Assignment Operator)

The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.

Example:

```
let x = 10;

```

## 2. += (Addition Assignment Operator)

The += operator adds the value on the right-hand side of the operator to the variable on the left-hand side.

Example:

```
let x = 5;
x += 3; // x is now 8

```

## 3. -= (Subtraction Assignment Operator)

The -= operator subtracts the value on the right-hand side of the operator from the variable on the left-hand side.

Example:

```
let x = 5;
x -= 3; // x is now 2

```

## 4. *= (Multiplication Assignment Operator)

The *= operator multiplies the variable on the left-hand side with the value on the right-hand side of the operator.

Example:

```
let x = 5;
x *= 3; // x is now 15

```

## 5. /= (Division Assignment Operator)

The /= operator divides the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side of the operator.

Example:

```
let x = 15;
x /= 3; // x is now 5

```

## 6. %= (Modulus Assignment Operator)

The %= operator assigns the remainder of the variable on the left-hand side divided by the value on the right-hand side of the operator.

Example:

```
let x = 15;
x %= 4; // x is now 3

```

Assignment operators can be used in combination with other operators to provide more functionality. They are very useful in reducing the amount of code needed to perform a certain operation.
