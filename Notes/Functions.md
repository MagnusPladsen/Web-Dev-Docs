## [Regular Functions](Regular%20Functions.md)

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. They are reusable blocks of code that can accept input parameters and return values. Functions help to organize code into logical blocks, making it easier to read, debug and maintain.

## [Arrow Functions](Arrow%20Functions.md)

Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for creating functions in JavaScript. They have a more concise syntax than traditional functions, making them easier to read and write. Arrow functions also have some unique behaviors, like automatically binding the 'this' keyword to the surrounding context and always returning a value.
