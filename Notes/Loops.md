Loops are one of the fundamental concepts in JavaScript programming. They allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. There are four main types of loops in JavaScript, which are:

## [For loop](For%20loop.md)

The for loop is used when you want to loop a fixed number of times. It has three parts: the initialization, the condition, and the increment. For example:

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   console.log(i
```


## [While loop](While%20loop.md)

The while loop is used when you want to loop until a certain condition is met. It only has a condition part. For example:

```
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
   console.log(i);
   i++;
}

```


## [Do-while loop](Do-while%20loop.md)

The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is false. For example:

```
let i = 0;
do {
   console.log(i);
   i++;
} while (i < 5);

```
