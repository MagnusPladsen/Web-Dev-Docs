JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.

To check the type of a variable in JavaScript, the `typeof` operator can be used. This can be useful for debugging and for writing code that handles different types of data appropriately.

## [**Number**](Number.md)

This includes all numeric values, including integers and floats. Examples include `1`, `3.14`, and `42`.

## [String](String.md)

This includes any text value. Examples include `"hello"`, `'world'`, and `"123"`.

## [**Boolean**](Boolean.md)

This includes the values `true` and `false`.

## [**Null**](Null.md)

This represents the intentional absence of any object value.

## [**Undefined**](Undefined.md)

This represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

## [**Symbol**](Symbol.md)

This is a new data type introduced in ECMAScript 6. Symbols are unique and immutable values that can be used as object keys.

## [**Object**](Object.md)

In JavaScript, an object is a non-primitive data type that includes arrays, functions, and other objects. It is used to store collections of data and related information.

## [Array](Array.md)

An array is a special variable, which can hold multiple values at the same time. In JavaScript, an array is a collection of data items that are of the same type.
