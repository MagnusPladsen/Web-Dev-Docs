JavaScript is a very versatile programming language that allows you to create complex web applications. One of the essential components of JavaScript is its methods. In this document, we will discuss some of the most important methods used in JavaScript.

## [String Methods](Web%20Dev%20Docs/Notes/String%20Methods.md)

String methods are used to manipulate strings in JavaScript. Some of the commonly used string methods are `charAt()`, `concat()`, `indexOf()`, `lastIndexOf()`, `replace()`, `slice()`, `split()`, `substr()`, and `toLowerCase()`. These methods help in tasks such as finding the position of a character, replacing a character or a substring, and converting the case of strings.

## [Math Methods](Math%20Methods.md)

Math methods are used to perform mathematical operations in JavaScript. Some of the commonly used math methods are `Math.abs()`, `Math.ceil()`, `Math.floor()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()`, `Math.pow()`, `Math.random()`, and `Math.round()`. These methods help in tasks such as finding the absolute value, rounding off numbers, and generating random numbers.

## [Array Methods](Array%20Methods.md)

Array methods are used to manipulate arrays in JavaScript. Some of the commonly used array methods are `concat()`, `filter()`, `join()`, `pop()`, `push()`, `shift()`, `slice()`, `sort()`, `splice()`, `toString()`, and `unshift()`. These methods help in tasks such as adding or removing elements from arrays, sorting arrays, and converting arrays to strings.

## [Date Methods](Date%20Methods.md)

Date methods are used to work with dates and time in JavaScript. Some of the commonly used date methods are `getDate()`, `getDay()`, `getFullYear()`, `getHours()`, `getMilliseconds()`, `getMinutes()`, `getMonth()`, `getSeconds()`, `getTime()`, and `toString()`. These methods help in tasks such as getting the current date or time, extracting specific parts of a date, and converting dates to strings.

## [Regular Expression Methods](Regular%20Expression%20Methods.md)

Regular expression methods are used to work with regular expressions in JavaScript. Some of the commonly used regular expression methods are `exec()`, `test()`, `match()`, `search()`, and `replace()`. These methods help in tasks such as searching for patterns in strings and replacing parts of strings.
