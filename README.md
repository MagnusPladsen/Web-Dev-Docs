# Web Dev Docs

## Summary

This is a personal project and experiment with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) where i will create simple docs for those who are seeking to learn Web Dev.

For this to work as intended you will need the **[Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint)** plugin for Obsidian.

The notes are created using prompts to Chat-GPT AI and my notes from school.

This project is note done and i will update it when i get some time.
