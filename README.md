# Web Dev Docs

## Summary

#### This is a personal project and experiment with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) where i will create simple docs for those who are seeking to learn Web Dev.

#### The notes are created using prompts to Chat-GPT AI and my notes from school.

#### This project is note done and i will update it when i get some time.

#### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is very powerful a note-taking application that uses markdown files to create and organize notes.

#### For this to work as intended you will need the **[Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint)** plugin for Obsidian.

#### Waypoint is an Obsidian plugin that automatically generates tables of contents/MOCs within your folder notes.

## Step-by-step Guide

### 1. Download and set up [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
#### 1.1 Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
Click the **Get Obsidian** button to download the application

#### 1.2  Create your [Vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault).
A Obsidian Vault is a folder on your computer that stores your notes in markdown files. I would highly reccommend to store this folder in a cloud service, you can also choose to pay Obisidian for their own cloud sync if you prefer. Then you can easily access this in the mobile application and it will always be backed up. You can also backup the Vault with GIT.


### 2. Download [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) for Obsidian
#### 2.1 Download plugin
Download the Waypoint plugin from this [link](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint) or navigate to  **Obisidian -> Preferences -> Community Plugins -> Browse** and search for **Waypoint**.

#### 2.2 Activate plugin
Community plugins in Obsidian will need to be manually activated after the installation is done. Navigate to  **Obisidian -> Preferences -> Community Plugins -> Browse** and find **Installed plugins** and click the switch to activate **Waypoint**

### 3. Clone this repo
`git clone https://github.com/MagnusPladsen/Web-Dev-Docs` or by using the same link to **Clone repo** in [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application.


### 4. Copy the folder from the repo inside your Obsidian Vault folder
Copy the whole **Web Dev Docs** folder and paste in inside your Obisidan [Vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault).


### 5. Use links to navigate between the different pages
The docs are using a [linking](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) system where you can navigate by clicking the links in each note.
