JavaScript provides a range of built-in mathematical methods that can be used for various purposes. In this document, we will discuss some of the most commonly used math methods in JavaScript that will be helpful for beginners.

## 1. Math.round()

The Math.round() method is used to round a number to the nearest integer. It takes a single argument, which is the number you want to round. Here is an example:

```
let num = 4.6;
let roundedNum = Math.round(num); //returns 5

```

## 2. Math.ceil()

The Math.ceil() method is used to round a number up to the nearest integer. It takes a single argument, which is the number you want to round up. Here is an example:

```
let num = 4.2;
let roundedNum = Math.ceil(num); //returns 5

```

## 3. Math.floor()

The Math.floor() method is used to round a number down to the nearest integer. It takes a single argument, which is the number you want to round down. Here is an example:

```
let num = 4.9;
let roundedNum = Math.floor(num); //returns 4

```

## 4. Math.pow()

The Math.pow() method is used to raise a number to a specified power. It takes two arguments, the base number and the exponent. Here is an example:

```
let base = 2;
let exponent = 3;
let result = Math.pow(base, exponent); //returns 8

```

## 5. Math.sqrt()

The Math.sqrt() method is used to find the square root of a number. It takes a single argument, which is the number you want to find the square root of. Here is an example:

```
let num = 25;
let squareRoot = Math.sqrt(num); //returns 5

```

## 6. Math.random()

The Math.random() method is used to generate a random number between 0 and 1. Here is an example:

```
let randomNum = Math.random(); //returns a random number between 0 and 1

```

These are some of the most commonly used math methods in JavaScript. They can be used for various purposes such as rounding numbers, calculating powers, finding square roots, and generating random numbers.
