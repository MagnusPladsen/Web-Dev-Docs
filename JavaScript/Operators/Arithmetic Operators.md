Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming.

An *[operator](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/operators?page_ref=catalog)**  *is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in *arithmetic operators*, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

1. Add: +
2. Subtract: -
3. Multiply: *
4. Divide: /
5. Remainder: %
The first four work how you might guess:

```
console.log(3 + 4); // Prints 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Prints 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Prints 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Prints 3

```

Note that when we console.log()the computer will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print that result to the console. If we wanted to print the characters 3 + 4, we would wrap them in quotes and print them as a string.

```
console.log(11 % 3); // Prints 2
console.log(12 % 3); // Prints 0

```

The remainder operator, sometimes called *modulo*, returns the number that remains after the right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: 11 % 3equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.
