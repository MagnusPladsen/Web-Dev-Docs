JavaScript includes a variety of operators that allow you to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operations.

## [Comparison Operators](Comparison%20Operators.md)

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false). The following are the comparison operators in JavaScript:

- Equal to (`==`)
- Not equal to (`!=`)
- Strict equal to (`===`)
- Strict not equal to (`!==`)
- Greater than (`>`)
- Less than (`<`)
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
- Less than or equal to (`<=`)

## [Arithmetic Operators](Arithmetic%20Operators.md)

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between two values. The following are the arithmetic operators in JavaScript:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)
- Increment (++)
- Decrement (--)

## [Logical Operators](Logical%20Operators.md)

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return a Boolean value (true or false). The following are the logical operators in JavaScript:

- AND (&&)
- OR (||)
- NOT (!)

## [Assignment Operators](Assignment%20Operators.md)

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The following are the assignment operators in JavaScript:

- Assignment (=)
- Addition assignment (+=)
- Subtraction assignment (-=)
- Multiplication assignment (*=)
- Division assignment (/=)
- Modulus assignment (%=)

These are some of the most commonly used JavaScript operators. Understanding how to use them is crucial to writing effective JavaScript code.
