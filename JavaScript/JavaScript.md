JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in web development. It is a versatile language that can be used both on the client-side and server-side. JavaScript is typically embedded in HTML pages and is executed on the client-side by web browsers.

JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages, dynamic effects, and to add functionality to web applications. It is also used in server-side programming, such as with Node.js, to create full-stack web applications.

JavaScript is a powerful language that has a wide range of libraries and frameworks available, making it a popular choice for web development. It is also relatively easy to learn, making it accessible to beginners.

Some of the key features of JavaScript include its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and work with asynchronous programming. It is also a flexible language that allows developers to write code in different styles, such as object-oriented, functional, or procedural.

Overall, JavaScript is a crucial tool in web development and has played a significant role in shaping the modern web.
