Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be displayed on a screen, on paper, or in other media. It provides a way to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, making it easier to maintain and update websites. CSS offers a wide range of style options, including font styles, colors, backgrounds, and layouts. It is an essential tool for web developers and designers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
CSS also allows for creating responsive design, which means that the website can adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as phones and tablets. This is achieved by using media queries and adjusting the styles accordingly.

In addition to the standard CSS, there are also preprocessor languages such as Sass and Less, which offer additional features and functionalities, such as variables, mixins, and nested rules.

Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for creating beautiful and functional websites, and it is constantly evolving to meet the needs of modern web development.
