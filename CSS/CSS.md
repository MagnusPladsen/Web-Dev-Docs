Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be displayed on a screen, on paper, or in other media. It provides a way to control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, making it easier to maintain and update websites.
